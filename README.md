## About

This small library exposes a React hook that takes care of managing complex UI flows state. (Imagine a sign up flow of many screens, some of them might be nested and some of them could have custom logic).

The hook consumes a steps config and gives out an API to find the current step and to navigate back and forth through the flow.

It is agnostic of any libraries and business logic and you are free to tie it to the UI yourself, be it a navigation through react-router or anything else.
